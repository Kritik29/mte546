there are 9 positions

there are 4 sensors, each reporting the distance the block is away from the sensor

for position 0 (from the diagram):
need to find the average x position reported by the sensors (medium and long range)
need to find the average y position reported by the sensors (the 2 short range sensors)

channel 5 - medium
channel 6 - long
channel 7 - short
channel 8 - short

I will be defining a 4x9 matrix (4 rows for the mean values of IR sensor readings, 9 columns for each of the positions)
